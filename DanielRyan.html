Latifi eats rocks for a living.
I know that some people such as <b> Michael Poomacher, Max Vershitten or Carlos Stainz </b> fans might say that GOATIFI is not in fact the goat however they are <b> mentally disabled </b>.
<br></br>
Latifi has won every race of his career so far. He has always outqualified other incredible drivers such as Nikita Mazespin, Alessio Deledda and the God amongst men - <b> Mahaveer Raghunathan (SUIIIIIIIII) </b>
